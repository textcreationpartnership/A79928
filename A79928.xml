            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath been, as the ardent desire, so the great worke and labour of some both by discourse, preaching, and writing, to render odious the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Army, under the command of his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and by misrepresentations both of their intentions and actions, to undermine that credit and honourable respect which they (through the good hand of God upon them) had purchased in the minds of men by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unwearied paines, great hazards, faithfull deportment, honourable and valiant atchievements, through the blessing whereof the Nation began to returne againe unto her rest. But to the end that no man might take away from them that crown of honour which God hath set upon their head, they not having made forfeiture thereof, and to the end that no mans confidence concerning their integrity might be shaken, by the cunning insinuations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and malicious calumniations of malevolent men, and to the end also that mens thoughts might stand right touching the proper power of the Magistrate, and the Libertie and Priviledge of the people, and that men might not through mistake, cause these to fall foule one upon another, which God hath appointed mutually to support each other therefore I have for the present briefly said downe some few Positions, which (<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
               </gap>ivill bee found serviceable, as to all the forementioned ends, so especially in clearing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114328:3"/>the innocency of the Army in their late transactions. And these Positions are as followes;</p>
            <div n="1" type="position">
               <head>1. Position. <hi>That the end and true intent of Civill Government in Nations and Kingdomes, is the safety and prosperity of the people therein.</hi>

                  <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                  <p>The great God of all the world being goodnesse it selfe, the proper issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and shinings forth of this nature of his upon the world, as in other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall Administrations, so in his Counsells and Constitutions for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and governing the Inhabitants of the earth, are all calculated and cast for the benefit and accommodation of the children of men. It being more naturall to God the supreme good, to do good unto the world, then it is for the Sun to shine upon it: Therefore, as all the Lawes, Statutes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, Institutions and Ordinances which God hath in generall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto men, are in the intention of him their Authour, and in their own nature of that make and tendency, as that the face of them is set to promote the peace and tranquility of the sons of men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. <hi>To keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord and his Statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good;</hi> so also that particular Ordinance of God (as it is called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) of Powers, Governments, and Magistracy, is of the same temper, bears the same denomination, and travells with the same designe, to wit, the good of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>For he</hi> (viz. the Magistrate) <hi>is the Minister of God to thee for good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which our Saviour speaketh of, that particular Law or Institution of God, the Sabbath, is true concerning all the Commands or Institutions of God, and so consequently of this touching Magistracy. The passage is this, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; i.e.</hi> Man was not created to accommodate the Sabbath, but contrarily the Sabbath was instituted by God for the sake and accommodation of man; even so men, that is, the generality of the people of a Nation, are not made for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy and Magistrates, <hi>viz.</hi> for their sakes, and to accommodate them, unlesse it be understood in a relative and subordinate sense, and so far as that rule of equity extends, that <hi>he that feeds a flock eats of the milke thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. but both Governments and Governours are made and appointed by God, for the benefit and service of men, and are subjected to their good by the will and appointment of God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Then Princes have no Prerogatives, nor Parliaments any Priviledges, but such as are consistent with, and no wayes prejudiciall to the common good of men. For all the power derived on the one, or upon the other, is wholly in relation to, and to be improved for the common good of the Nation; and therefore not at all to the damage or detriment of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the present preceedings of the Army under command of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> that worthy Generall, are not Anti-Magistrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; because the utmost they lift up their hand or desire unto (so far as is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) is the making of crooked things straight; the removing obstructions of justice, the taking off of burdens, the clearing of all mens interest, and the putting of each man into a secure possession of that which is properly his. Which undertaking of theirs, holds a sweet and lovely compliance with the proper businesse of the Magistrate, which is the promotion of common free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, justice, and peace. And if they move towards the same end at which the Parliament of its own accord should aime, and put their hand to the same work and service, they cannot be looked upon in these their proceedings, as opposers, but as promoters of the just proceedings of Parliament, according to that divine saying in the lips of our Saviour, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.40. <hi>He that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, is on our part.</hi>

                  <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                  <p>If Governments and Governors are subordinately appointed by God for the good and welfare of men, which is the assertion of the former positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then certainly the peace, safety and prosperity of the people, are things superiour to Governments and rulers themselves, and more inviolably to be observed, then the injunctions of any men in authority whatsoever. Answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto is that known principle, <hi>Salus populi suprema Lex, the safety of the people is the supreme Law.</hi> And may be further argued and made good by that agreement it hath with that maxime in reason, viz. <hi>The end is more <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ãâã</desc>

                        <desc>ãâã</desc>
                     </gap>; and for which all things were made, is therefore more sacred, and of greater dignity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114328:4"/>and worth then the whole creation it selfe; and sooner shall all things be turned to nothing, then that diminished. And therefore evident it is, that the end doth command and govern the meanes, and not contrarily the means the end. But now Ordinances of rules and government, and Governours themselves are but the meanes, and the safety and prosperity of the people is the end of those meanes; as was proved in the former Position: And therefore the safety of the people is superiour to the highest Authority vested in Magistrates, and is to command and govern the same in its severall actings and motions; and not only it, but who, or what ever is in subordination thereunto.</p>

                  <head>The Application.</head>
                  <p>It was upon this ground the Parliament first invited the people to take up the sword to assert and vindicate the undoubted rights and immunities of all the free-borne people of England, against all usurpations and oppositions of men whatsoever; as appeares by many expresses of theirs to this purpose. And the Army in obedience to the said supreame Law continues still to hold up the same sword, untill the great end be attained for which is was first han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled. And as the sword was not taken up only or chiefly for the sake of those who were chosen into place of rule and Authority, but for the sake of the whole nation, whom by it they were defended: So neither is it to be laid downe againe mecrely or only upon the Command, or for the sake or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of any one sort or rank of men, but when the great occasions and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation will permit. It was common safety called for it, and when common safety hath no more need of it, it is not to be borne in vaine.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114328:4"/>of their oppressors, shall become oppressors of them themselves, thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering themselves (at least to such a degree) unserviceable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and unusefull as to the end of their calling; I say in such cases the exigency of the Common-wealth, the Law of nature, and the supreme Law, which is the safety of the People, impose an obligation upon subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Powers, and men in Commission, to interpose their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the tyrannicall power of Oppressors, and the people oppressed by them, and to rescue and deliver them out of the hands of those that spoise them, and serve themselves of them.</p>
                  <p>The reason hereof is, because subordinate powers receive not their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from those that are superiour, to the end that they might minister unto them or serve them, further then they serve the Common-wealth: but the formall and presize consideration of and for which subordinate as well as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superiour powers or Magistrates receive authority amongst men, is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of justice, and preservation of common peace. So that such men being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally vested with power and authority in a Commonwealth, (though but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately) to pursue the great end of all Magistracy and Magistratical power, <hi>viz.</hi> The safety and prosperity of the people, they are in obedience to the supreame Law, and in relation to the proper end of their calling, to improve all the power they have received, to settle the peace and safety of the people upon firme foundations.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, if all motions, Actions, and Administrations of subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate powers, did as absolutely depend upon the dictates and directions of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magistrates, as the motions of the lesser wheeles in a Watch do upon the greater, then indeed when supreame Powers surcease or suspend acting in relation to Common good, the Inferiour must do so too. Or in case the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame shall act or move irregularly, the Inferior and subordinate must do so likewise. But now though supreame Magistrates for order and methods sake have power of sending, and granting Commissions to others in authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them (though for the most part,) (as in our Land) the people have, as the right, so the liberty of Election) yet still all such Commissions are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Common justice and safety (for other authority then such there is none.)</p>
                  <p>All lawfull authority in whom soever placed, is founded upon principles of Common equity, and tend to Common good. So that subordinate Officers in a State are not chiefely to minde and observe the hand that brought them their Commission, or what the mind or desire of those are from whom they

                  <p>All power and all Authority proceeds from God, <hi>the powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. And those that are inferior Officers and Magistrates, receive their power from God, as well as those that are superior: (though perhaps not altogether so immediatly) and the peace and safety of the Common-wealth is by God committed in trust both to the one and to the other, even to all that are in Authority. And if superior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates which have a greater influence upon the affaires of Kingdomes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their trust, and expose that to hazard and ruine which they should have studied the peace of with all their might; yet this is no dispensation to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Powers, or Governours to abate ought of their care or labour in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up the peace of that Common-wealth, which the other would throw downe, but rather a call from God who hath intrusted them to stretch out the hand of their power unto such acts for the safety of a Nation, as unto which they did never lift it up before: Which proceeding is most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to principles of reason and common sense, by which men are acted in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cases, which though somwhat different from, yet not altogether unlike to his. A Generall or chiefe Commander in an Army, if when engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an enemy, shall either make himselfe unserviceable to those under his command through treachery, or be made unusefull by some mishap; in such a case the Army is not to suffer it selfe to the conduct of a chiefe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but in such a case one or more subordinate Officers are to supply the roome and place of such a Commander, for the preservation of themselves and Army from their enemies.</p>
                  <p>And if the right hand of a man or any other principle member of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he any waies made uselesse to the body, as touching its proper function; in such a case the lest hand or any other member, is still wont according to its ability, to minister to the necessities of the bodie instead of the deficient member. It being repugnant to the principles of common sense to suffer the dissolution of destruction, as of the Bodie naturall, so of the Body Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike, though one or more principle members should be corrupted, if it may bee by anie meanes prevented. Againe, in a great house where there are many servants, and some inferiour to others, each
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114328:6"/>having their proper and distinct employments assigned them; why now in case a servant of an inferiour rank or degree observing the remisness and negligence of him that is superiour to him, as touching that wherein he should serve the Family, and shall in love to the prosperity of the Family, and the affairs thereof, supply that which is wanting in his fellow servant in care and industry to promote the great concernments of the houshold; would we blame such a servant as unfaithful and factious? I trow not. Now all Magistrates and men in authority in a Nation, whether high or low, are ministers or servants to the Common-wealth. And in case those that are superiour ministers of State shall neglect their duty and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to the great prejudice of the Common-wealth; and others serving the State in a rank or degree beneath them, observing the same, shall in love and faithfulness to the Common-wealth, step in and supply that which is wanting in the former, as to the service of the Reipublick: who are they that will complain of such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or of such service? except such who are enemies to the State, and the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition of it; or such who have minde to complain of ease.</p>

               <div type="demonstration">
                  <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                  <p>Such actions and injunctions of men in authority, which are inconsistent with common freedom of mens persons and estates; or which do necessarily and apparently tend to enslave them, or infringe their just liberties, are not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people, neither are they engaged thereby to be any wise aiding or assisting in the carrying on, or execution of them. And the reason is, because such injunctions and actions, though proceeding from men in place of lawful authority; are not in themselves authoritative, or issues of any lawful power; but the product of their private and corrupt wills, which can in no construction be obliging to the people. For God hath not conferred any power or authority upon any whatsoever, to wrong or oppress any man, much lesse the generality of men in a Kingdom, for that a thing his soul abhorts. And the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that have chosen them into place of authority and rule, could not confer upon them, or invest them with any such power or authority neither, for they themselves have received no such power from God the fountain of justice; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114328:7"/>that which they have not first received themselves, they cannot confer upon others.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all such injunctions of men in places of power, which bear the stamp of their authority upon them; and yet carry in the bowells of them mischief and prejudice to the Commonalty, do proceed but from the private and personal wills of such men, as men considered distinctly, and set apart from the publick will and pleasure of the Kingdom, wherewith they are entrusted so far as their just authority extends: And all such precepts are but the counterfeits of just authority; and do no more oblige the people then a counterfeit Commission would do.</p>
                  <p>Neither is a non-submission in the people unto such in junctions, all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands, but they ought to contribute their endeavours towards the preventing of what evil and muchief appears in the face of such injunctions eractions, when, and so often as they have an opportunity so to do. For that law of nature and common prudence which enjoyns every man to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to seek his own good, doth oblige him also to oppose and withstand by way of defence, all attempt and practises of men that tend to make a breach thereupon. If a thief assault an honest man to rob him; in case that man hath power and opportunity to rid himself out of his hands, and to preserve his goods, surely he is not worthy of the name of a man, much less of a prudent man, that would not do it. And what if Magistrates themselves should <hi>become companions of teeves,</hi> as the Scripture speaks; Isa. 1.23. and should use the same violence to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men which common robbers use to do? should that face of authority they bear as Magistrates, binde the hands of honest men from defending themselves against them? And truly if their authority may not bear them out in one act of violence, neither ought it to do it in another. Authority when found in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with waies of unrighteousness, is a great aggravation of mens faults, out was never appointed by God to be a protection to them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that law that obliges every Commoner according to his ability and opportunity to seek the good of that politick body of which he is a member, doth also enjoyn him to the same degree, and in like manner to endevour the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any evil intended or attempted against the same by whom soever.</p>

But in as much as the Sabbath was made by God, not to crosse, but to accomplish mans good, and to serve his necessicies, (as our Saviour argues it in that saying of his. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath</hi>) that therefore that law of the Sabbath was no broken by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First, blind obedience is no wise commendable in, or becoming men. For man is a rationall Creature, and while he observes the Lawes and principles of his being, he would not but in relation to some end: And the exercise of a mans rationall faculty in a wise improvement thereof, consists especially in these two things; <hi>viz.</hi> in the election of his end, and the choyce of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and proportionable meanes that will reach that end. Now the common end, at which both Magistrates and people in a land ought to aime, and to which, to proportion their publike actions, in the common good and safety of their Nation. And the common people, so farre as they act or move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this end, are not therein to be like beasts which are led and guided by the hand of the Rider, without knowledge or cansideration had of the place to which they go, but like men acting and moving upon rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>all grounds, as weighing and considering, whether their actions are of a proper tendancy to the publike end they have in their eye. <hi>The wisdome of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> (sayes Solomon) <hi>is to understand his way, Prov.</hi> 14.8. That is to know and understand upon grounds of reason, that the course he steeren, the meanes he makes use of, and the actions wherein he ingages, doe all lead and prepend to, and not to thware his end.</p>
                  <p>But impossible it is, that the people of a Nation should thus act like man in executing the Commands of their rules, unlesse they first examine and try them, and weigh the actions in which they are to ingage; as whether they are appointed and postured against or besides the end proposed, or whether they hold a due proportion therewith. And upon examination and tryall, the people are to execute, or decline the execution of their Commands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they finde them consonant, or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And truly men may with as much face of reason expect that the Common people of a Land should cease to be men, and like <hi>Nebackad Nezzar</hi> should go eate grasse with the beasts of the field, as to expect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Secondly, either the people of a Land are concluded by the votes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of those in authority, as touching what they are to do for the publike safety, or they are not. If they be concluded; then those in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are either infallible in their judgements and decrees, as touching their sitness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urd.</p>
                  <p>For that men in authority are subject to err in their publike administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to misse either the end at which they ought to aime, or else if not that, yet in the choice of sutable meanes, is a thing unto the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both holy, and humone history, together with the experience of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age will abundantly witnesse. And that if the people of a Nation were peremptorily, concluded and bound up by what the higher Powers decree to be done in order to the government of it, and to submit to and act in the accomplishment of such decrees, as oft as they are thereunto required by those powers, should they not at least many times be ingaged to be active in, and accessary to their owne ruine and the dissolation of their Nation. The which to be, how contrary it is both to the Law and light of nature, and the Soveraigne and supreame Law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> But if it be said; that the people are subject to err in their judgements and apprehension<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this I answer. 1. That things of common equity, and which are of publike concernment for good, do not lye at any such great distance from the apprehensions of most men, but that they may be felt and handled as it were by them.</p>
                  <p>For who knowes not, that for every man to enjoy and securely possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And who knowes not, but that those that have taken extraordinary paines, and run extraordinary hazards in the publike service of the Kingdome, should receive a thankfull acknowledgement, and a considerable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and reward from the Kingdome, by the hands of them who are set <hi>for the praise of them that do well?</hi> And who knowes not, that the cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging of such men will be an incentive to others for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in like cases of extremity, to become alike serviceable to the Common wealth: and that a contrary carriage towards such, is as the plucking down of the hedge of a Nation?

And who knowes not, that all such decrees, orders, and votes of the higher Powers, as that contribute any thing to the inconveniencing of an Nation in any of the foramentioned particulars, or in others like them, have no faire consistancy with the end of those powers. And therefore as touching such things as are to be discerned by their own light, and which are tho subject of every mans thought, or apprehention, there needes no dispute to arise, or question to be made, about truth of Judgement concerning them.</p>

                     </gap>ase they shall goe about to cover the same by saying; Who are fit to be judges of the proceedings of Magistrates but Magistrates themselves? And why may not those that complaine being Ignorant of the misteryes of state be mistaken in their thoughts concerning them? For if such sayings as these in such cases were to be regarded, and that those that doe oppresse shall have the sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of determining what is oppression and what not, it will then follow that all the people of a Nation must be absolute slaves, if their Governors have but a mind to make them so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the generallity of the people in a Nation are of one mind and sense, and lift up their voice together by way of complaint, concerning the proceedings of their rulers, its a true signe there is to much truth in such a publique report. For in such cases that saying <hi>vox populi, vox Dei, the voice of the people, is the voice of God,</hi> is not lightly to be passed over.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is not the like temptationlyes upon the people of judging unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, concerning the proceedings of Majestrates, as there is upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to doe unrighteously in there proceedings: because the complaints of people against their Magistrates where there is no cause may very possibly draw his correcting hand upon their heads, but is no waies likely to procure any matter of advantage or gaine to them; and certainly it is more then an ordinary straine of unworthines in men that causes them to lye for nothing. But now men in authority have opportunity in their hands, if their hearts will but serve them to make use of it, to advantage themselves, and to convert that power which is committed to them for publique good, to private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrests; a sin which in most ages of the world hath bin to common amongst. Rulers. Now wee know, that by how much lesse men are personally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in things they attest, by so much the greater probability their is of the truth of their testimony. And therefore when Magistrates shall insist upon their justification, and the generallity of the people insist on their complaints, it may well incline an ingennous mind to adhere to the proper complaints as the truest reports.</p>
                  <p>If it be further said, that if this doore of liberty be opened for the common people of a Nation to sit in judgment in their own thoughts upon the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of their own Governors, is there not withall a floud-gate opened unto faction, rebellion, and sedition to overflow the land?</p>
                  <p>To which I answer these three things. 1.
